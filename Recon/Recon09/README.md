# Recon 08

## This exercise covers aliases in TLS certificates


## Objective

### For this challenge, your goal is to access the alternative names in the certificate.

## Alternative names

### When accessing a TLS server, it often pays off to check the content of the certificate used. It's common for TLS servers to have certificates that are valid for more than one name (named alternative names). Looking for alternative names can be done in your client or by using openssl.
