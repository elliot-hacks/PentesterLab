# Recon 04

## This exercise covers common interesting directories


## Objective

### For this challenge, your goal is to find a directory that is commonly used to manage applications.

## Interesting directories

### When accessing a new webserver, it often pays off to manually check for some directories before starting to brute force using a tool. For example, you can manually check for /admin/.


## Solution:

### So I used dirb to perform directory listing
